# Project Description

This project aims to handle some challenges which are highly likely situations in a data analysis process such as file handling, data formatting and data pre-processing. The final goal of the project is to visualize the data, have good insights and find opportunities.

This study will include 5 stages:
1. Find or produce a dataset. The dataset will be in excel file format because most of it is pretty common in businesses.
2. Convert the excel file to a sqlite3 file.
3. Create queries on SQL to have insights.
4. Get the data ready to present with visualisation.
5. Work with machine learning on data. (additional)

# Project Description

This projects aims to hadling some challenges which is highly likely situations in a data analysis process such as file handling, data formatting, data pre-processing. The final goal of project is visualizing the data, having good insights and finding opportunities.

This study will include 5 stages:
  1. Finding or producing a dataset. The dataset will be in excel file format because of most of it is pretty common in businesses.
  2. Converting excel file to SQL file, I probably will use sqlite3 for that.
  3. Doing queries on SQL to have insights and seeing the patterns of customer behaviours.
  4. Viualizing the data.
  5. (additional) Working with machine learning on data. Clustering algorithms may be good for that.
